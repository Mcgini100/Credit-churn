# FOR THE TEAM 

>Here are some tips on how you can make your contributions to GitHub as effective and efficient as possible:

>1. Use meaningful commit messages: When you make changes to the code, make sure that your commit messages are clear and meaningful. Your commit message should summarize the changes you made and why you made them.

>2. Create feature branches: When working on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch in the repository. This will allow you to work on your changes without affecting the main branch, and it will make it easier to review your changes before merging them.

>3. Keep changes small and focused: When making changes to the code, try to keep the changes small and focused. This will make it easier to review your changes and will reduce the risk of introducing bugs.

>4. Write clear and concise code: When writing code, make sure that it is clear and concise. Use meaningful variable names, write comments where necessary, and follow the coding style of the project.

>5. Test your changes: Before submitting your changes, make sure that they are tested and working as expected. This will reduce the risk of introducing bugs and make it easier for other developers to review your changes.
